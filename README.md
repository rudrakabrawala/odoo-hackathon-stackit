## Project Description
StackIt is a scalable, modern Q&A platform inspired by Stack Overflow, designed with a clean, minimal UI using React and TailwindCSS. It enables users to ask questions, provide answers, vote, accept answers, and receive notifications. The backend is powered by Node.js, Express, and MongoDB, ensuring robust performance and scalability. StackIt aims to foster knowledge sharing in a user-friendly, distraction-free environment.

## Future Scope
- **Real-time Collaboration:** Integrate Socket.IO for live notifications and updates.
- **Advanced Search:** Implement full-text and semantic search for better question discovery.
- **Gamification:** Add badges, leaderboards, and reputation rewards.
- **Moderation Tools:** Enable flagging, review queues, and admin dashboards.
- **AI Assistance:** Suggest similar questions, auto-tagging, and answer recommendations using AI.
